In the past 3 years I explored multiple disciplines: marketing, sales, graphic design. I, as young people do, had a distorted perception of myself and the world around. I had to bump into reality and collect some bruises to adjust the professional trajectory. So, through aching bruises, here are the factors that brought me to Data Science:

**Applied Sciences Makes One Effective** 

I want to be useful. Robust linear reasoning is essential for getting things done. A lot of the most productive people of this planet have backgrounds in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics. These fields have rich toolkits, but the biggest alpha they add is honing one's thinking. Students of applied sciences are forced to think systematically, they learn to isolate and quantify variables. Because applied sciences are so black and white, it's hard to fake success - you can't bullshit your way into mathematics. 

Steve Jobs said:

_"You have to work hard to get your thinking clean, to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."_

If I could go back to grade 7, I would invest time in Physics and Programming (not buy bitcoin). Mastery of a skill feels more rewarding than money, at least for now.

Data Science is at the intersection of Programming and Statistics. I want to be competent in both, so why not get 2 in 1? 


**What else to do?** 

Thinking about one's mortality is a powerful coordinating practice. Everything gets in line: what will my life be about? what do I need to get done? what do I want? I never chose to be born. I'm thrown into the ocean called life and if I don't learn to swim, I drown. It's easy to end up nihilistic. Hedonic whims are no replacement for meaning. Things that bring immediate pleasure (scrolling tiktok, sweet food) don't fill the void. Plus, I adapt to the stimilus; I either need more of the thing or more intense version of the thing to feel the same high.

Voluntary discomfort turns out to be the best response to nihilism.  

One must be courageous. If you're scared, do it scared. Running towards fear is a lifehack. In a way, I have nothing else to do but try to understand the things that scare me - maths, statistics, programming. 

Getting insights from data doesn't sound romantic, but it's a powerful tool to understand the world better.
