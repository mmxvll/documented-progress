In the past 3 years I probed into multiple disciplines, the most prominent being marketing, sales, graphic design. I, as young people do, had a distorted perception of myself and the world. I had to bump into reality and collect some bruises to adjust my professional trajectory. Below I put forward key factors that, in my current estimation, brought me to Data Science.

**Applied Sciences produce effective leaders:** I want to be useful. Robust linear reasoning is esential for getting things done. A lot of the most productive people on this planet have backgrounds in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics. These fields have rich toolkits to be effective. But the biggest alpha they add is honing one's thinking. Student's of applied sciences learn to think systematically, they learn to quantify and isolate variables. Because applied sciences are so black and white, it's hard to fake success - you can't bullshit your way into mathematics. 

If I could go back to grade 7, I would invest more in Physics and Programming. Not because tech jobs pay so well, but because I can be one of those who build the future.

Data Science is at the intersection between Programming and Statistics. I want to be competent in both, so why not get 2 in 1?
