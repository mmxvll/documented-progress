In the past 3 years I probed into multiple disciplines: marketing, sales, graphic design and more. I, as young people do, had a distorted perception of myself and the world. I had to bump into reality and collect some bruises to adjust my professional trajectory. Below I put forward key factors that brought me to Data Science.

**Applied Sciences produce effective leaders:** I want to be useful. Robust linear reasoning is essential for getting things done. A lot of the most productive people on this planet have backgrounds in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics. These fields have rich toolkits. But the biggest alpha they add is honing one's thinking. Students of applied sciences learn to think systematically, they learn to quantify and isolate variables. Because applied sciences are so black and white, it's hard to fake success - you can't bullshit your way into mathematics. 

Steve Jobs said:

_"You have to work hard to get your thinking clean, to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."_

If I could go back to grade 7, I would invest more in Physics and Programming. Not because tech jobs pay so well, but because I will learn to move mountains.

Data Science is at the intersection of Programming and Statistics. I want to be competent in both, so why not get 2 in 1? 

**Life is a tragedy:** I never chose to be born. I'm thrown into the ocean called life and if I don't learn to swim, I drown. It's easy to end up nihilistic. Hedonic whims are no replacement for meaning. Things that bring immediate pleasure (scrolling tiktok, sweet food) don't fill the void, they distract from pain. Plus, I adapt to the stimilus - I either need more intense version of the thing or more volume of the thing to feel the same high.

The remedy for nihilism is leaning into the pain. Voluntarily going through discomfort turns out to be the best response for adversity - you don't run away anymore. 

I can't eliminate fear unless I do a brain surgery, so the ocean will be dreadful forever. The way out of that is to build courage. If you're scared, do it being scared. Running towards fear is a lifehack. In a way, I have nothing else to do but set to master things that scare me - technical concepts, statistics, algorithms.
