After coming back from Poland I'm back at square one. It's as if I returned to the day I graduated school and have to decide what's next. But this time it's without parents paying
for university and with an ongoing caution about conscription. 

I'm 21. It's likely the most amount of freedom remained yet. Free shelter, free food, no assignments due, no pressure to "be on time". Freedom is a great opportunity to address knowledge gaps (i.e., math) and to prepare for a career of choice. But returns on foundational education come with delay; progress isn't as fast as it _"should"_ be.

I've had my detours. Practically, I spent 20 of the last 24 months doing various tutorials/courses. The Tutorial Hell is hell because you push the lever, but don't get the **desired** reward. Solving linear equations is rewarding, but less rewarding than turning competency into income.  

Absence of tangible progress makes me feel like a loser. My friends seem to have their act together; sometimes people's success looks insulting, it raises questions about my own inadequaces.
