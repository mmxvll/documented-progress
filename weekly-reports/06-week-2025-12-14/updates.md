After coming back from Poland I'm back at square one. It's as if I just graduated school and have to decide what's next. But this time it's without parents paying
for university and with an ongoing caution about conscription. I'm 21. It's likely a period of most freedom remained for me. Free shelter, free food, no assignments due, 
no pressure to "be on time". 

Freedom is a great opportunity to address knowledge gaps (i.e., math) and to prepare for a career as a data-scientist. 
But returns on foundational education come with delay. Solving linear equations is rewarding, but less rewarding than turning competency into income. 

Tutorial hell is hell for a reason. 

I recognize that my highest priority is to get an income. How do I work for competent people when I'm in a rectum of the world in a house filled with children and military looking 
out for people outside. Why make it harder for myself when I can just make sure I'm hirable and leave this place. I can address my gaps as hoc. 

Organizations and people drift towards doing empty work. Competitive environment makes everything matter more; everything is important, but some things are more important than others.
I shouldn't compensate for my lost youth yet. I can still do a great job at my current pursuit. Nothing stops me except for myself. I'm the biggest obstacle on the way.
