More I get into the weeds, more I realize that I suck more than I thought. So I expect this to be an evolving document.

**Mathematics Basics:**
- ["Basic Mathematics" by Serge Lang](https://g.co/kgs/Wtvp9MZ)
- [Kiselev's Geometry: Planimetry](https://g.co/kgs/TqBY4e4) (_just because I avoided geometry at school_)
- [Elementary Geometry for College Students](https://a.co/d/iuCKrw8) (_so now it's masochistic will to knowledge_)
- [College Algebra by Mark Dugopolski](https://g.co/kgs/L6UA3JT)
