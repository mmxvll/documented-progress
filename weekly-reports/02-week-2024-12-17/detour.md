As I went through exercises in _Introduction to Linear Algebra by G. Strang_ I discovered that I'm less mathematically mature than expected. I took a course on Linear Algebra in University and got a sufficient grade, which gave some confidence, but confidence didn't help with psets. Despite reading the related chapter, problems were still cryptic to me.

Here's what ChatGPT said about that: 

_"Strang’s Introduction to Linear Algebra doesn’t formally require advanced prerequisites, but it does assume a level of mathematical maturity.. ..problems are intentionally designed to build deeper understanding and intuition, so you might not recognize the solution path immediately.
 ..If book feels like a steep climb, starting with a more accessible linear algebra book can be a great strategy."_

Starting from the beginning feels discouraging, but it's a strategically correct decision. No surprise the problems were hard: MIT teaches with this book, so there's an assumption of a solid math background. Anyway, I will come back to it with stronger foundations. 

For now I'm doing _[Linear Algebra and Its Applications by David C. Lay](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-5th/dp/032198238X)_ and _[Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/)_
