**What did you get done this week?**

Less than I could've. This week was slow, mainly because I caught a flu, but also because of New Year holidays. I spent more time reading and catching up on saved podcasts. Big themes were Introduction to Mimetic Theory, general business insights, general productivity insights. 

I felt guilty for missing almost a week on math stuff. Losing momentum is a real thing, especially psychology-wise. All of a sudden studying looks like a steeper mountain than it was before (and flu doesn't make things easier). I was reflecting on uncertainty of results, whether I'm wasting my time doing the basic math. People my age have careers that they're after. Easy to feel like a loser, so it's crucial to not let oneself quit. 

What helped me is listening to David Senra's Founders [episode #373 - Breakfast with Brad Jacobs](https://www.founderspodcast.com/episodes/373-breakfast-with-brad-jacobs-how-to-make-a-few-billion-dollars). Brad wrote about "going to school on everybody"; that whenever he gets into a new industry he gets his hand on anything that will give information: periodicals, journals, press releases, CEO interviews, SEC filings, talking to employees, analysts, vendors, to anyone who lives and breathes the industry, including journalists, VCs, any investment funds whose return depend on deeply understanding the market. 

Brad's obsession resembles Edwin Land who read all the books on light in three libraries. It says that (1) all returns are returns on education, (2) highest returns come from having an information edge, (3) information edge comes from unexpected sources.
