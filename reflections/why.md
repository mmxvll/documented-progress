**Why work a lot?**

A somewhat tragic component of human condition is that to be happy one must voluntarily invite challenge. Human species evolved to master survival. We did it so well that now we observe the nightsky, do nipple piercings, and argue about politics. There's a vast supply of entertainment, food, and substances at our disposal. It's never been easier to fulfill our whims of desire. 

There's something shallow about a life without adversity. Humans love conflict, especially males. If we don't have problems to solve, we make up our own.
