**Write the truth. Write it in a way that gives answers, not confuses.**

A tragic component of human condition is a realisation that in order to be happy one must voluntarily invite challenge. That's like the ultimate joke from the universe.

Human species evolved to master survival. We did it so well that now we observe the nightsky, do nipple piercings, and argue about politics. There's a vast supply of entertainment, food, and substances at our disposal. It's never been easier to stay comfortable. 

There's something shallow about a life without adversity. Humans love conflict, especially males. If we don't have problems to solve, we make up our own.
